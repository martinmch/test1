Hi all.

I went to DIKU today for a lecture. I had a deadline today for submitting my
bachelor project contract. I have settled on a bachelor project and found a
supervisor. More on that later.

At DIKU, I had a talk with my classmate T from high school. We weren’t the
closest of friends in high school, but we had some good times. I enrolled at
the university of Copenhagen straight after high school.  T had a gap year
traveling the world. This also explains my astonishment when I saw T today.
He’s got an apartment by the lakes in Copenhagen. I reckon his view must be
amazing. I hope another opportunity might show for us to spend some time
together.

As we passed February 16<sup>th</sup>, there is now less than a month to our
marriage. We have arranged most things by now and only minor details remain.
Trine has found a nice dress, and I have found a nice suit. We are renting an
inn in Mid Jutland close to a nice big lake. We’ve sent out invitations and
received replies from everyone.

All the best,
Christiansen
