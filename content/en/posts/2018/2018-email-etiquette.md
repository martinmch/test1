E-mail is an abbreviation for electronic mail. Mail is a system for
interchanging letters. So to better understand e-mail, we should understand
regular mail.

Regular mail begins in your house. You're sitting at the front-line in the
trenches. The bombing has finally stopped, you don't know for how long. You get
out a piece of paper, and a pen to scribble your last thoughts down for your
family to read. You begin by putting the date down in the upper right corner,
and then you're greeting. We'll get back to writing the body of the letter. In

Dear Mom

                                    I've written two or three times recently
so you may get them together. I've been so very busy lately. The shells have
been pouring out on to the hills. I'm really looking forward to my furlough
in two weeks time. I'll be spending it in Paris buying presents for all of
you.  We've been spending days on end in these muddy brown trenches. I al-
most can't feel my feet anymore. Really looking forward to walking around
the garden in my bare feet, feeling the green grass between my toes once
more.

With love
your son
Arthur
