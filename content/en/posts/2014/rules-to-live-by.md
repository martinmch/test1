# Keep your hands out of your pockets

# Always tuck in your shirt

# Always return a borrowed car with a full tank

# Quality trumps quantity


<!--
- The importance of an orderly mind.

- Stay focused on the task at hand.

- Don’t draw attention to your self.

- If you think you’re done, you’ve just begun.

- Trust no one.

- Remain alert at all times to the reality of the present. Because all we have
  is right now.

- Don’t confuse good luck with a good plan.

- Always be prepared to improvise.

- Watch, look, and listen, or you won’t know what you’re missing.

-  Don’t just react to a situation that takes you by surprise. Respond.

-  Trust your instincts.

-  Let the other guy do the talking.

-  You only get one chance to make a first impression.

-  Ask all questions in the order of their importance.

-  Be quick but don’t hurry.

-  Always look people in the eye. Give them a handshake they’ll remember.

-  Start each day by saying it’s good to be alive. Even if you don’t feel it,
   saying it - out loud - makes it more likely that you will.


-  When everything goes wrong, treat disaster as a way to wake up.

-  There must always be a relationship between evidence and conclusion.

-  Fortune favors the bold.

-  Whenever your head is too full of noise, make a list.

-  When there’s trouble, think fast and act decisively.

-  You can’t change anything if you can’t change your mind.

-  What you’re told to believe isn’t important: it’s what you choose to believe.
   It’s not the ink and paper that matter, but the hand that holds the pen.

-  Once is an anomaly. Twice is a coincidence. Three times is a pattern. And as
   we know…

-  There is no such thing as a coincidence.

-  Let people underestimate you. That way they’ll never know for sure what
   you’re capable of.

-  You could also think of coincidence as synchronicity.

-  Sometimes the only way to deal with a bully is to hit first. Hard

-  It’s not a bad thing, sometimes, if they think you’re crazy.

-  Even the slightest advantage can mean the difference between life and death.
   Never give it away.

-  Act as if you’re in charge, and people will believe you.

-  Trying times are not the times to stop trying.

-  Never make excuses.

-  Sleep when you’re sleepy. Cats take naps so they’re always ready for
   anything.

-  The bravest thing is not always the smartest thing.

-  Cooperate with the authorities. But don’t name friends.

-  If strangers know what you’re feeling, you give them the advantage.

-  Out of control anger will get you killed even quicker than stupidity.

-  Never start a fight unless you can finish it. Fast.

-  When all else fails, just breathe.

-  In times of chaos, stick to routine. Build order one step at a time.

-  The only thing you can’t afford to lose is hope.

-  To break the ice, always compliment a man’s hometown.

-  And always sympathize with his hometown’s football team.

-  If you can’t be on time, be early.

-  If you fail to prepare, you prepare to fail.

-  Giving up is easy. Finishing is hard.

-  If you want to know what’s going on in a small town, hang around the
   barbershop.

-  Facing the truth is a lot easier, in the long run, than lying to yourself.

-  Sometimes you find out more when you ask questions to which you already know
   the answer.

-  If you don’t like the answer you get, you shouldn’t have asked the question.

-  If you want something done the right way, do it yourself.

-  If you don’t want people to notice you, act like you belong there and look
   busy.

-  The best way to lie is to include part of the truth.

-  The dumbest guy in a room is the first one who tells you how smart he is.

-  Never sign a legal document that hasn’t been approved by a lawyer who works
   for you.

-  When you’re in trouble, emphasize your strengths.

-  When in a new place, act like you’ve been there before.

-  Learn the difference between tactics and strategy.

-  99 percent of the things you worry about never happen. Does that mean
   worrying works or that it’s a complete waste of time and energy? You decide.

-  When you need to make a quick decision, don’t let what you can’t do interfere
   with what you can.

-  When you gain the advantage, press it to the limit.

-  The Swiss Army doesn’t amount to much, but never leave home without their
   knife.

-  There’s a reason the classics are classics: they’re classic.

-  Don’t make another’s pain the source of your own happiness.

-  Go easy on the hard sell. Persuasion is the art of making others believe it
   was their idea.

-  Never take more than you need.

-  Without a life of the mind, you’ll live a mindless life.

-  Just because you’re paranoid doesn’t mean that sorry is better than safe.

-  When nothing else works, try chocolate.

-  Never be nervous when talking to a beautiful girl. Just pretend she’s a
   person, too.

-  Men want company. Women want empathy.

-  Always listen to the person with the whistle.

-  There is not - nor should there be - any limit to what a guy will go through in
   order to impress the right girl.

-  If you want people to tell you more, say less. Open your eyes and ears, and
   close your mouth.

-  You can find most of the weapons or equipment you’ll ever need around the
   house.

-  Regarding eyewear and underwear: always travel with backups.

-  Don’t watch your life like it’s a movie that’s happening to someone else.
   It’s happening to you. It’s happening right now.

- Stay alive.

- If you really want to keep a secret, don’t tell anybody.

- You can’t live your life two days at a time.

- If you have to hide your true feelings from your friends, they’re not your
  friends.

- If any task you undertake requires you to “die trying,” you might want to
  reconsider your plan.

- Healing takes much longer than you think. The biggest scars you carry aren’t
  the ones you can see.

- Those who can’t do, don’t.

- Sometimes, in order to get completely sane, you have to go a little crazy.

- Do the right thing, always, and risk the consequences.

- Take care of the minutes, and the hours will take care of themselves.

- When visiting a foreign land, it is always wise to observe and abide by the
  customs of the local culture. Unless they’re trying to eat you.

- It doesn’t matter how you do it. It only matter that you do it.

- In the face of overwhelming odds, do one smart thing at a time.

- Read books to get smarter. Read people to become wiser.

- Being brave means being afraid and going ahead with it anyway.

- An open door is either a greeting or a trap. Best to decide which before you
  enter.

- When you reach the end of your rope, don’t hang around.

- Keep your friends close. Keep your enemies in a bag at the bottom of the
  river.

- All you need is love. And some friends you can trust.  And a little luck
  doesn’t hurt either.

- Don’t ever give up on anybody.
