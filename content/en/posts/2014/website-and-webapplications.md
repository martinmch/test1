The world wide web has evolved into two major categories: websites and web
applications. This is my personal way of distinguishing between the two.

Websites:

- Focus on content
- Stays the same
- Links are reliable
- Browser behavior is backwards compatible
- Promotes web surfing
- All people have their own site
- Works[^1] without javascript

Web applications:

- Dynamic
- Promotes staying on few pages.
- Keeps all people on the same sites.
