      <p>The concept having a music collection has changed drastically since I was a kid.
I was raised with CD collections (and from these ripped mp3 collections). These
were very common, and there were certain CDs that everybody had in their
collection.</p>
<p>When I was studying, I found the process of selecting and moving music to my
cellphone was tedious. Further more, the software for managing music and
playlists on my cellphone was subpar. Instead I&rsquo;d pick out ~the~ 3-5 CDs that I
wanted to listen to that day, and bring them and my discman. This solution
worked well although carrying CDs around isn&rsquo;t always practical.</p>
<p>Today, nobody owns CD&rsquo;s anymore, and most people don&rsquo;t own the music they listen
to, but stream it from various providers. The ease and flexibility of this
solution is very attractive. This solution has some cons for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>I&rsquo;m often (most of the time) offline.</li>
<li>I have an intricate way of labeling and creating playlists.</li>
<li>Music streaming providers don&rsquo;t have all the music I like.</li>
<li>Streaming an album multiple times will amount to a bunch of network traffic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take &ldquo;A Rush of Blood to the Head&rdquo;, my favorite Coldplay album, as an example.
I&rsquo;ve listened to this entire album twelve or fifteen times this year. The album
takes up 127 MB of storage when compressed in a zip file. This amounts to
1905 MB = 1.9 GB. According to
<a href="https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/does-irresponsible-web-development-contribute-to-global-warming/">Emerge</a>,
one GB of data produces 3kg of CO2. Thus my listening to Coldplay produces
almost 6kg of CO2. And that&rsquo;s not even counting the power used by my laptop or
my speakers.</p>
<p>My original solution to this, was the same as it was twenty years ago. I have a
folder on my PC called <!-- raw HTML omitted -->music<!-- raw HTML omitted --> indexed by authors and then by albums.
That&rsquo;s all fine and dandy.</p>
<p>But say I&rsquo;m at work, and want to listen to one of my CD&rsquo;s. That&rsquo;s no problem, I
just copy my music folder to my work laptop. This has several issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don&rsquo;t want my personal music collection on a laptop I do not own,</li>
<li>my music collection is large (&gt;50 GB), and</li>
<li>I would have to update it, if I bought a new album.</li>
</ul>
<p><del>As of now, I have my entire music collection on a portable SSD harddrive, and a
backup on my file server. To ensure the least possible amount of data usage, I
use an <code>rsync</code> command, that only copies new files to the directory, instead of
blindly copying and overwriting every single file.</del></p>
<p><del>This way I get the portability of moving all of my albums around weighing close
to nothing, and but still have to remember my drive to be able to listen to
music.</del></p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> I now use <code>syncthing</code> to synchronize my music between all my
workstations. The downside to this is, that I have to reserve 50GB on each of my
machines for music. Since I&rsquo;m not using the 500 GB SSD for anything else, this
doesn&rsquo;t really matter for now.</p>
<p>Not everything is perfect.</p>
