      <p>This website is my collection of documents on the World Wide Web. I won&rsquo;t
guarantee that the documents won&rsquo;t be updated and altered, but I&rsquo;ll do what&rsquo;s
in my power to keep all links alive and well.</p>
<p>When I launched my first website, and a good many years after that, I was a
little uncomfortable with it. But people I trust have persuaded me that some
might find it interesting, and I realized that it would allow me to
acknowledge those who&rsquo;ve helped me along the way. I don&rsquo;t like to brag on
myself, and I won&rsquo;t start now.</p>
<p>I got my first website in 2002 coinciding with when I learned HTML. At that
point, I used it for sharing game modifications, and pictures/diaries from
vacations. It also contained HTML versions of some emails I&rsquo;d sent.</p>
<p>In university, I used it my website for sharing notes with my fellow students.
When I was teaching classes, I&rsquo;d use my website as a general repository for
handouts, lecture notes and other course related papers.</p>
<p>Since then the web has evolved so unbelivably fast. And naturally, I&rsquo;ve swum
with the current. Dynamic websites, CMS, web applications, and most recently
static website generators. I won&rsquo;t be bashing any of these here.</p>
<p>In 2013, a couple of weeks after recreating my personal website as a web
application using Ruby on Rails, I realized how much my website had changed,
and how far it&rsquo;d gotten from its original intent. Sharing (semi-public)
documents with the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>I immediately reverted my website back to a static HTML website, and later to
a static website generated from markdown files. This was all fine and dandy,
but I still felt a distance to the content on my website.</p>
<p>I have finally taken the ultimate step and now maintain my website the same
way I did back in 2003. A collection of documents (mostly HTML) interlinked in
the World Wide Web, to hopefully be of value to someone (Hi, Mom!).</p>
